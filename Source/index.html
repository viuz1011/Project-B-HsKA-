                                Play is quite a powerful concept to add to one's potfolio. If you are familiar with Java, you will love Play Framework.
                                The documentation is easy to approach and understand. With already-done projects provided
                                to guide users through the different stages. One can hardly get tired with the ideas therein.

                            Play Framework is an open-source web application framework which follows 
                            the model–view–controller (MVC) architectural pattern. It is written in Scala
                            and usable from other programming languages that are compiled to JVM Bytecode,
                            e.g. Java. It aims to optimize developer productivity by using convention over
                            configuration, hot code reloading and display of errors in the browser.
                                Play was created by software developer Guillaume Bort -

                                <p>
                                The goal of this page is to demonstrate Play Framework using Scala and ScalaJS.
                                There are other pages out there, by other authors, that are also 
                                sufficient to do more. They are recommended. 	
                                    To start, go 
                                    <a target="_blank" :href = "links('https://developer.lightbend.com/start/?group=play&project=play-samples-play-java-forms-example')" >there</a>
                                    to downlaod a starter project;
                                    or you may go to their Github 
                                    <a :href="links('https://github.com/playframework/playframework')" target="_blank">
                                        page
                                    </a>; or you may proceed to clone directly the whole package from my
                                    <a :href="links('https://github.com/playframework/playframework')" target="_blank">
                                    repository
                                    </a>
                                    . This page  started
                                    with the Play Framework package with ScalaJS already installed.
                                    	Below is what the structure looks like after a successful cloning: 
                                </p>
                                
                                <h2>Project Structure</h2>
                                <p v-html ='display( "Drawable/b1.jpg" )' ></p>

            <p>
                One can easily notice three most important folders in the project structure above. The 
                first is <b>client</b> folder, which holds the ScalaJS files. The second folder, which is 
                <b>server</b> is the folder which holds the actual Play Framework application. Note that if you plan to 
                use ordinary Javascript with Play Framework, this structure may not be necessary. You, may then continue 
                with <b>Model (M) View (V) Controller (C)</b> structure; and Play application doesn't have to stay 
                within the <b>server</b> folder. Once you clone from my repo, you will have all these files available to you 
                immediately. 
            </p>
            <h2>Exploring each folder.</h2>

            <p>
                Now the relevant folders will be expanded and explained gradually. The below folder is the folder
                housing our JavaScript written in Scala.
            </p>

                        
                                <p v-html ='display( "Drawable/b2.jpg" )' ></p>
                                <p>
                                    If one who has written Javascript before takes a closer look at this 
                                    <b>javascript.scala</b> page, they can easily notice that it is still
                                    the same as in ordinary Javascript. The  difference lies only in the syntax. The <b>main</b> gets called each time 
                                    the application is compiled. The method <b>getElementsBySelector</b> is then called
                                    to fetch elements by their respective ids. Notice that the first three lines within 
                                    the method are similar to the way it is called in ordinary Javascript. Same way, same idea, one 
                                    continues writing thier ScalaJS. Please

                                    This folder holds our Play application just like mentioned above. Notice that within 
                                    this folder, there is controller, model, and view folders; the standard Play structure.
                                    It is within this controller class that you decide what the user should and should 
                                    not see. For instance, you may decide the template to serve the user from this 
                                    controller page. You can still write as many Scala codes and methods as you desire 
                                    to meet your demand or the demand of your application within this controller class.
                                     You can also pass values from the controller class to your individual templates 
                                     and use them within the template.
                                </p>

                                    <strong>Note: </strong> the template engine used in Play is
                                    <a :href="links('https://github.com/playframework/twirl')" target="_blank">Twirl</a>. 
                                   It's okay to have a little understanding of Twirl to be able to navigate 
                                   your way across your template files just fine.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Twirl is quite easy to use and understand. Template engines 
                                    allow us to do more in HTML. HTML on its own is just a markup language; but 
                                    with template engines, we can write <strong> for loops</strong>, 
                                <strong>while loops</strong>, <strong>conditional statements</strong>, 
                                    and so on within our HTML script. Template engines are powerful and easy to use. 
                                    There are other template engines as well, like: 
                                    
                                </p>

                                     Below is the standard way of passing values from the controller class 
                                     to the template script.

        Okay, there is, obviously, a lot going on in this method. It will be carefully explained
        one line at a time. Line 113 checks to make sure that the user does not type into the 
        input a very long name that is clearly unrealistic. To prevent this, a helper is 
        written to keep the users in check and ensure that proper string lengths are typed into the 
        input field. Line 114 is where the session is retrieved to tell our app the last time this 
        particular user was seen. If you have worked with PHP before, the concept of sessions may 
        not be entirely far from you. The idea is the same, just different definition. Session 
        variables store temporary information, sometimes to use for retrieving and 
        viewing data on multiple web pages. On line 116 a class is written, within which a 
        <strong>processData</strong> method is defined to help process user data. This method returns a 
        list of <strong>StudentsData</strong> objects. This list is then passed to the 
        <strong>secretary.scala.html</strong> template to be used there. On line 121, all the parameters
        relevant to the <strong>secretary.scala.html</strong> page are specified.
                                </p>

                                <h2>The model folder.</h2>

                                    This folder is very important in PlayFramework. It, along with the other two -- 
                                    <strong>controllers</strong> and <strong>views</strong> -- complete 
                                    the Play paradigm. The 
                                    <strong>createTables.scala</strong> script needs to be properly configured 
                                    in order to run it successfully. The <strong>Tables</strong> script 
                                    seen included within this folder is generated automatically each time
                                    <strong>createTables.scala</strong> script 
                                    is run successfully. It is not a good idea to change the contents of the 
                                    <strong>Tables</strong> script. Although if you break this file, you can still come to 
                                    this <strong>createTables.scala</strong> script and run it again to auto-generate a new 
                                    one.
                                </p>

                                <h2>The view folder</h2>
                                <p>
                                    This folder holds the view templates as shown below. These templates are controlled in the 
                                    controller class and served to the user. The template engine used here is Twirl. 
                                    Twirl, just like every other template engine, lets us do more with our template
                                     than we would without it.
                                </p>

                                    The take-away here is line 1 through 6; that is actually how to recieve data from the controller 
                                    class. These data are then spread across this page and fixed in their respective positions to 
                                    serve their individual perposes.
                                </p>

                                <h2>The routes file</h2>
                                <p>
                                    This file is another important file in Play Framework. You can not navigate across multiple pages without 
                                    the routes file. Please see below:
                                </p>

                                <p v-html='display( "Drawable/b8.jpg" )' ></p>

                                <p>
                                       The <strong>routes</strong> script is located in the <strong>conf</strong> folder.
                                       Within this script, you define the different paths relevant to your application.
                                       You can see from above the different paths defined, which are important to this particular 
                                       project. This script must be contacted first before the controller. For instance: in your 
                                       JavaScript page, or even template page, to be able to navigate to another page, you have to 
                                       specify the path first.
                                </p>

                                <p v-html='display( "Drawable/b9.jpg" )' ></p>
                                <p>
                                   Looking at line 158 of the above picture, you see that <strong>secretary</strong> 
                                   which is on line 19 of the <strong>routes</strong> script is specified as the path to follow here. 
                                   So what will happen here is that our program will go first to the <strong>routes</strong> 
                                   script to look for this particular path. Because it is there, it will proceed with the 
                                   <b>controller.UsersController.secretary()</b> and invoke that secretary method in the 
                                    controller class. Within this method, our template is served to the user.
