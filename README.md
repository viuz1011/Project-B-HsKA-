# Welcome - Summer 2020 project B.
***
This repo is dedicated to my summer 2020 project B at [HsKA](https://www.hs-karlsruhe.de/). The ``index.html`` in the root dir is an uglified version of this website. Please go to ``/source`` dir to see the unminified version. This is just a simple page to summarise Play Framework and present the contents of my project, including the wireframe. Please go [here](https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_kgwJVH0=/) to view the wireframe of this project. [Miro](https://miro.com/) white board was used for this purpose. Miro supports wireframing.
